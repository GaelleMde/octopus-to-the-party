# Description

Octopus to the Party is a game where players must catch as many shrimps as possible to feed the little pulpi√±o, while avoiding the trash that falls into the sea. Each shrimp eaten earns 1 point, but touching trash causes pulpi√±o to lose 1 life. The game ends when the player loses 5 lives. Afterwards, the score is calculated.

The game raises awareness about environmental pollution while paying tribute to Galician culture. 'Octopus to the party' is a common mistranslation by tourists when referring to the traditional Galician dish 'Pulpo √° feira.'"
